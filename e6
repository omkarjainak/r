ou should have these Java files:

Node.java ‚Äì Remote interface

Message.java ‚Äì Serializable message class

BullyNode.java ‚Äì Implements Bully algorithm

RingNode.java ‚Äì Implements Ring algorithm

‚úÖ Compilation Steps
1. Start RMI Registry (in the background)
Open one terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
rmiregistry &
Make sure this stays running in the background.

2. Compile All Files
In the terminal from your project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
javac *.java
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Bully Algorithm
Each node must know its own ID and the ID of the next node. Example setup for 3 nodes:

Terminal 1
bash
Copy
Edit
java BullyNode 3 2
Terminal 2
bash
Copy
Edit
java BullyNode 2 1
Terminal 3
bash
Copy
Edit
java BullyNode 1 0
You can adjust the IDs and nextNodeId values accordingly.
Each node will auto-start an election after a delay.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Ring Election Algorithm
Same approach, different class.

Terminal 1
bash
Copy
Edit
java RingNode 3 1
Terminal 2
bash
Copy
Edit
java RingNode 1 2
Terminal 3
bash
Copy
Edit
java RingNode 2 3
This forms a ring: 3 ‚ûù 1 ‚ûù 2 ‚ûù 3

üí° Tips
You must start the RMI registry (rmiregistry) before running the nodes.

nodeId and nextNodeId must match actual node setups. Mismatches will cause lookup() failures.

All nodes should be run from the same directory or make sure CLASSPATH includes current directory (.).
