✅ Steps to Compile and Run
Start the RMI Registry (in one terminal):

bash
Copy
Edit
rmiregistry &
Compile all Java files:

bash
Copy
Edit
javac *.java
Start nodes (in separate terminals)

Let’s assume you have 3 nodes: node1, node2, node3. Each will bind to its own RMI name and know the name of the next.

Start node1 and pass "init" to start the token:

bash
Copy
Edit
java TokenRingNodeImpl node1 //localhost/node2 init
Start node2:

bash
Copy
Edit
java TokenRingNodeImpl //localhost/node2 //localhost/node3
Start node3:

bash
Copy
Edit
java TokenRingNodeImpl //localhost/node3 //localhost/node1
Make sure each node uses different terminal windows and that the rmiregistry is running in the background.

✅ What You Should See
Each node will register itself and connect to the next.

The token will be passed from one node to another.

Nodes will enter the critical section periodically (every ~5s).

⚠️ Common Issues
java.rmi.ConnectException: Ensure the RMI registry is running (rmiregistry) and each node uses correct URLs.

Wrong node name/lookup failure: Make sure Naming.lookup() uses full RMI name, like //localhost/node2.
